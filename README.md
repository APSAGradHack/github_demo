## What is GitHub?
Git (minus the "hub") is a "version control system" - software designed to let people collaborate on the same body of code and keep track of how each file in the project was edited over time. GitHub is a website that displays these projects (called "Repositories") and their edit histories (called "Commits") and allows users to contribute to projects or adapt existing code for new projects.

This is very useful for projects where many people edit the same content at the same time and it also gives you a full history of all changes, so you can go back to an old version of your code if something goes wrong.
